# Dynamic Typography Workshop

This project is meant to show the layers of good responsive web typography, though it's pretty scaled down.

The main two pages to look at right now are book_01.html and book_01_working.html. The idea will be that the 'working' file does not yet include all of the finesse features you see in the first file.
