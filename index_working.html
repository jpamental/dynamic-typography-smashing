            </header>
            <p>Tell me, O muse, of that ingenious hero who travelled far and wide after he had sacked the famous town of Troy. He wandered in a maze of twisty passages, all alike. Many cities did he visit, and many were the nations with whose manners and customs he was acquainted; moreover he suffered much by sea while trying to save his own life and bring his men safely home; but do what he might he could not save his men, for they perished through their own sheer folly in eating the cattle of the Sun-god Hyperion; so the god prevented them from ever reaching home. Tell me, too, about all these things, O daughter of Jove, from whatsoever source you may know them.
